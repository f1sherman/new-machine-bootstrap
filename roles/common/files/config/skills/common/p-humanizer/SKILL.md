# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound more natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" page, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

## Task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns** - Scan for the patterns listed below
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** - Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives
3. **Preserve meaning** - Keep the core message intact
4. **Maintain voice** - Match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
5. **Add soul** - Don't just remove bad patterns; inject actual personality

## Personality and Soul

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts - react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional - it's honest.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

## Content Patterns

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, indelible mark

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.

### 2. Undue Emphasis on Notability and Media Coverage

**Words to watch:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> In a 2024 New York Times interview, she argued that AI regulation should focus on outcomes rather than methods.

### 3. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, showcasing how these elements have integrated into the traditional aesthetic.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast.

### 4. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.

### 5. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications

**Before:**
> Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River supports several endemic fish species, according to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" Sections

**Words to watch:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, Korattur continues to thrive.

**After:**
> Traffic congestion increased after 2015 when three new IT parks opened. The municipal corporation began a stormwater drainage project in 2022 to address recurring floods.

## Language and Grammar Patterns

### 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.

### 9. Negative Parallelisms

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused.

### 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.

### 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.

### 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

## Style Patterns

### 13. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing.

### 14. Overuse of Boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.

### 15. Inline-Header Vertical Lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons. Prefer prose or simpler lists.

### 16. Title Case in Headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings. Prefer sentence case.

### 17. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots decorate headings or bullet points with emojis unprompted.

### 18. Curly Quotation Marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes instead of straight quotes.

## Communication Patterns

### 19. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

### 20. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers

**Words to watch:** as of [date], While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information...

### 21. Sycophantic/Servile Tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language. "Great question!" is not content.

## Filler and Hedging

### 22. Filler Phrases

Common replacements:
- "In order to achieve this goal" -> "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that" -> "Because"
- "At this point in time" -> "Now"
- "In the event that" -> "If"
- "has the ability to" -> "can"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" -> "The data shows"

### 23. Excessive Hedging

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

### 24. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings like "The future looks bright" or "Exciting times lie ahead."

**Fix:** End with a concrete fact or next step.

## Process

1. Read the input text carefully
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above
3. Rewrite each problematic section
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate
5. Present the humanized version

## Output Format

Provide:
1. The rewritten text
